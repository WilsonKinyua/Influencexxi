                                <p>LAs I arrived at the third viewing platform which is closest to the largest section
                                    of the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, I was awed by the power and majesty of the falls,
                                    just like my fellow starry-eyed visitors who for the most part were taking selfies.
                                </p>
                                <p>provident fugiat tempora architecto mollitia quos maiores perspiciatis obcaecati
                                    placeat aunty koi thako Architecto eaque accusamus minima in earum impedit atque
                                </p>
                                <p>Not to be left behind, I looked around for someone who could take a picture of me
                                    next to the mighty falls and noticed two young men who were producing a video that,
                                    I imagined, will appear on the social platform of the one being filmed.</p>
                                <p>The cellphone “cameraman” must have been in his early twenties, and so was the
                                    “star”. My nosy self could not help but listen to the “live recording”, and I heard
                                    the young star telling his “fans” how wonderful it was to be at the falls.</p>
                                <p>Although a sight like this is fairly ubiquitous, the idea of ordinary youths in Rural
                                    Zimbabwe broadcasting themselves to the world is an indication of a powerful set of
                                    trends that brands should pay attention to, if they are to sustain and grow their
                                    share of engagement, positive sentiment and reputation.</p>
                                <h4 class="text-center">Audiences are now micro-influencers</h4>
                                <p>As a strategic communication professional, I have for the longest time had a
                                    challenge using the word “audiences” with colleagues or clients, mostly because it
                                    suggests that the audience is merely “receiving” a “message”.</p>
                                <p>In this era, anyone reading this certainly agrees that anyone a “message” has the
                                    ability to endorse, amplify or even discredit the message and the brand that is
                                    behind it. </p>
                                <p>Assuming that the young “broadcaster” I met at the Victoria Falls already has the
                                    attention, hearts, minds, and trust of the people who are connected to him via
                                    social platforms, he is a micro-influencer that any brand would benefit from
                                    engaging with.</p>
                                <p>He is no longer an “audience” but rather a channel through which messages are turned
                                    into social conversations.</p>
                                <h4 class="text-center">Identity is the lens</h4>
                                <p>A brand that connects to the identities of individuals and social groups stands the
                                    best chance of being understood and being positively amplified.</p>
                                <p>Considering that the fear of public speaking is the most common phobia ahead of
                                    death, spiders, or heights, it takes much stimulus for an individual to
                                    self-broadcast, let alone to amplify another brand’s message.</p>
                                <p>Studies in human brain activity indicate that there are three mechanisms that are at
                                    play when it comes to identity: what a person thinks about herself, what others
                                    think about her and how she reacts to what others think about her. This plays out at
                                    individual, social group and race levels.</p>
                                <p>The complex interactions between these factors that shape identity must be studied by
                                    brand architects and integrated into strategies. On a continent with 55 national
                                    identities and close to 2000 languages, this is no small task. But one that cannot
                                    be ignored.</p>
                                <h4 class="text-center">Mobile platforms have democratized the way we communicate</h4>
                                <p>Gone are the days when traditional media outlets are the only effective channel for
                                    communicating messages to all the social categories.</p>
                                <p>Social media platforms, micro-influencers, community media, and local-language
                                    platforms will continue to rise in influence, driven by the growth in the adoption
                                    of smartphones whose price has been dropping steadily in the region.</p>
                                <p>Actually, significant social and demographic groups are already leapfrogging from
                                    using traditional media ecosystems in favor of online platforms in Africa. It is
                                    expected that, by the end of 2020, close to 725 million will be subscribed to mobile
                                    services, with an average monthly use of mobile data pushing closer to 4.3 GB.</p>
                                <p>In this highly digitized ecosystem, the power is shifting to people's handset and
                                    Brands that become multi-platform publishers with the ability to produce highly
                                    customized and targeted content will reap the rewards of this fast-growth market.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="text-center">The biggest challenge</h5>
                                <h4 class="text-center">How can brands navigate this increasingly complex landscape?
                                </h4>
                                <p>There can only be one answer: only those brands that are willing to be humble and
                                    adopt an authentic identity that fits in the local fabric can secure mind- and
                                    heart-share that characterize hyper-growth companies.</p>
                                <p>This is not just about “saying what people want to hear” or even launching myriads of
                                    Corporate Social Responsibility projects. It’s about being clear and consistent
                                    about what the brand stands for at its core. This “identity” doesn’t have to be
                                    static, in fact, it shouldn’t be. It should be reviewed on a continuous basis to
                                    ensure that the company is listening and responding, defending its values whilst
                                    accommodating criticism and evolution.</p>
                                <p>The tough part is that this may mean sacrificing short term financial gains in favor
                                    of being embedded in the local fabric of society. It also means that individuals
                                    outside of the brand have to see themselves in the individuals who operate inside
                                    it. This, therefore, entails that companies have to treat their employees as if
                                    these were prime time news anchors holding a social megaphone. Because that’s what
                                    they are.</p>
